          <p>
            Hello, I'm Ryan Huntington, a passionate software engineer and
            developer with a love for creativity and problem-solving. With a
            background in computer science, I've always been fascinated by the
            intersection of technology and design.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey began in high school when I discovered my passion for
            computer science. I continued my education at Baylor University,
            where I pursued a degree in computer science, and graduated in May
            2024. Throughout my academic journey, I've gained expertise in
            various web technologies, including React, Java, C++, Python, PHP,
            and MySQL. Additionally, I've developed a robust skill set in deep
            learning, specializing in neural networks, natural language
            processing, and computer vision. I have also developed a strong
            analytical mindset and proven leadership skills, demonstrating
            meticulous attention to detail in solving complex problems and
            consistently meeting project deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in the power of collaboration and thrive in dynamic
            environments where I can exchange ideas and learn from others.
            Whether it's developing intuitive user interfaces, crafting
            compelling visuals, or tackling complex technical issues, I'm driven
            by a desire to create meaningful solutions that make a difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not immersed in projects, you can usually find me with my
            friends, taking care of my many plants, or pursuing my latest
            hyperfixation. I'm always eager to explore new interests and find
            inspiration in unexpected places.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feel free to reach outâ€”I'd love to connect and discuss how we can
            collaborate together.
